# Build a Camera-Based Touch Sensor

- Open the program with touch_input.py
- After a few seconds of calibrating, a window will open, which shows the camera feed with the fingertop contour drawn.
- Once the camera feed opens, you may start fitts_law.py
- Close the camera window with q.
- Design information can be found in documentation.py

## Touch-based Text Input
- Aside from barebones ideas in documentation.py, there is nothing else, due to me being gone for an entire week right after recovering, which is on me. Thanks to the time extension, I was at least able to work on the first part. Thank you! Despite time not being on my side the last few assignments, I really enjoyed the course.
