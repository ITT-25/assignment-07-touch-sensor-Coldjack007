    * there could be more details on how to put the camera than the two lines (-0.5P)
* Bounding boxes around fingers are detected robustly, palm-rejection works
    * mostly nopes (0.5P)
* Movement and taps can be distinguished and sent via DIPPID, making it compatible with the given Fittsâ€™ Law application
    * it's okay, but we can't reach all targets (-0.5P)
* Automatic calibration works
    * not really working (-1P)
* Documentation
    * minimalistic (-0.5P)
